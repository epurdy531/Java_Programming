I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out. 
I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a 
sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle above your 
nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts. I love that 
after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your 
perfume on my clothes. And I love that you are the last 
person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night. 
And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's 
New Year's Eve. I came here tonight because when you 
realize you want to spend the rest of your life with
somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon 
as possible.
